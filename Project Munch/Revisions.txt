Revision 1.1 4/19/13	(Tyler Mitchell)
-Added implementation for moving around a larger map surface
-Game map image altered to include a boundary (black)
-Changed player movement so the player stays centered
-Changed zombie movement speed and made it so that zombies only update
once every two clock cycles (gives player a slight movement advantage, balances
the game mechanics more)
-Zombie movement and spawn zones need to be altered still
-Map boundaries need to be polished still
-Player may not be a perfect circle, possible reason for rect position movement
during rotation

Revision 4/19/13 - Jonathan Byington

-Refactored a lot of the code to make it cleaner and more object oriented. 
-Pulled the new map code out of the main method and put it in it's own class to maintain readability.
-Cleaned up a few bugs in the code and polished the version.
-Zombie pathfinding is broken while we implement collisions and the new coordinant system for the big map. This is a work in progress.
